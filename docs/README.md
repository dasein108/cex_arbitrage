## Architecture Principles

This documentation reflects the system's commitment to:

- **SOLID Compliance** - Single responsibility, open/closed, interface segregation, dependency inversion
- **HFT Performance** - Sub-50ms latency targets with <1Œºs symbol resolution
- **Clean Architecture** - Unified interfaces, proper separation of concerns
- **Extensibility** - Factory patterns enabling seamless exchange integration
- **Safety** - Fail-fast error handling and comprehensive validation

## Documentation Standards

All documentation follows these standards:
- **Practical Focus** - Implementation guidance over theoretical concepts
- **Code Examples** - Real examples from the codebase
- **Performance Context** - HFT compliance and performance implications
- **Evolution Tracking** - Architectural changes and their rationale
- **Cross-References** - Links between related architectural concepts
