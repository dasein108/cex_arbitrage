# Hedged Cross-Arbitrage Backtesting System

## Overview

A comprehensive backtesting framework for hedged cross-exchange arbitrage strategies between MEXC spot and Gate.io futures with complete cycle simulation including transfer delays, exit via Gate.io spot, and detailed performance analytics.

## Strategy Logic

### Complete Arbitrage Cycle
1. **Entry Signal Detection**: Uses statistical thresholds (25th percentile) to identify favorable entry conditions
2. **Position Opening**: 
   - Buy MEXC spot (market order at ask price)
   - Sell Gate.io futures (market order at bid price)
   - Creates a delta-neutral hedged position
3. **Transfer Simulation**: Mandatory 10-minute wait period simulating inter-exchange transfer
4. **Exit Signal Detection**: Monitors for favorable exit conditions or forced close triggers
5. **Position Closing**:
   - Sell Gate.io spot (market order at bid price)
   - Buy Gate.io futures (market order at ask price)
   - Completes the arbitrage cycle

### Signal Generation

#### Entry Conditions
- MEXC vs Gate.io futures spread < 25th percentile of rolling minimums
- Uses sophisticated rolling window analysis (100-period windows, 50% overlap)
- Requires sufficient historical data (minimum 50 periods)

#### Exit Conditions
- Gate.io spot vs futures spread > 25th percentile of rolling maximums
- Forced exit after maximum position duration (24 hours default)
- Automatic risk management triggers

## Implementation Features

### Dual Mode Operation

#### 1. Real Market Data Mode
- Integrates with existing `ArbitrageAnalyzer` and `calculate_arb_signals`
- Downloads live candle data from MEXC, Gate.io spot, and Gate.io futures
- Uses advanced statistical signal generation
- Requires full project dependencies

#### 2. Standalone Simulation Mode
- Generates realistic synthetic market data
- Implements simplified but effective signal logic
- No external dependencies required
- Perfect for testing and education

### Risk Management
- **Position Limits**: Configurable maximum concurrent positions (default: 3)
- **Transfer Delays**: Realistic 10-minute minimum transfer simulation
- **Forced Exits**: Automatic closure after 24 hours to prevent infinite positions
- **Fee Integration**: Comprehensive fee modeling (0.2% total fees)
- **Spread Simulation**: Realistic bid/ask spread modeling (0.05% default)

### Performance Analytics

#### Core Metrics
- Total P&L with position-size scaling
- Win rate and trade distribution analysis
- Average holding periods and position management
- Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio)
- Maximum drawdown calculation

#### Advanced Analytics
- Profit factor calculation
- Detailed position lifecycle tracking
- Cumulative performance visualization
- Trade distribution histograms
- Spread analysis with entry/exit markers

### Configuration System

```python
@dataclass
class BacktestConfig:
    symbol: str = "F_USDT"
    days: int = 7
    timeframe: str = "5m"
    min_transfer_time_minutes: int = 10
    entry_threshold_percentile: float = 25.0
    exit_threshold_percentile: float = 75.0
    max_position_duration_hours: int = 24
    fees_bps: float = 20.0                    # 0.2% total fees
    spread_bps: float = 5.0                   # 0.05% bid/ask spread
    position_size_usd: float = 1000.0
    max_concurrent_positions: int = 3
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage with Real Data

```python
from trading.research.hedged_cross_arbitrage_backtest import HedgedCrossArbitrageBacktest, BacktestConfig

# Configure backtest
config = BacktestConfig(
    symbol="BTC_USDT",
    days=7,
    position_size_usd=5000,
    min_transfer_time_minutes=15,
    max_concurrent_positions=5
)

# Run backtest
backtest = HedgedCrossArbitrageBacktest(config)
results = await backtest.run_backtest()

# Generate report
print(backtest.format_report(results))

# Create visualizations
plots = backtest.create_visualizations(results)
```

### Standalone Mode (No Dependencies)
```python
from hedged_cross_arbitrage_backtest_standalone import HedgedCrossArbitrageBacktest

# Run with synthetic data
backtest = HedgedCrossArbitrageBacktest()
results = backtest.run_backtest_simulation("F_USDT", days=5)
print(backtest.format_report(results))
```

### Parameter Optimization
```python
# Test multiple configurations
symbols = ["BTC_USDT", "ETH_USDT", "F_USDT"]
transfer_delays = [5, 10, 15, 20]
position_sizes = [1000, 2500, 5000]

results_grid = []
for symbol in symbols:
    for delay in transfer_delays:
        for size in position_sizes:
            config = BacktestConfig(
                symbol=symbol,
                days=14,
                min_transfer_time_minutes=delay,
                position_size_usd=size
            )
            
            backtest = HedgedCrossArbitrageBacktest(config)
            results = await backtest.run_backtest()
            results_grid.append({
                'symbol': symbol,
                'transfer_delay': delay,
                'position_size': size,
                'total_pnl': results['performance'].total_pnl,
                'win_rate': results['performance'].win_rate,
                'sharpe_ratio': results['performance'].sharpe_ratio
            })

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Highlights
- **Separated Domain Pattern**: Clear separation between data loading, signal generation, and execution
- **Position Lifecycle Management**: Complete state tracking from entry to exit
- **Hybrid Data Sources**: Seamless switching between real and synthetic data
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient signal calculation with rolling windows
- **Memory Management**: Controlled historical data retention (500-period limit)

### Signal Algorithm Details
```python
# Entry Signal Logic
window_size = min(100, len(history) // 10)
rolling_mins = [min(window) for window in sliding_windows(history, window_size)]
entry_threshold = np.percentile(rolling_mins, 25)
signal = ENTER if current_spread < entry_threshold else HOLD

# Exit Signal Logic  
rolling_maxs = [max(window) for window in sliding_windows(history, window_size)]
exit_threshold = np.percentile(rolling_maxs, 25)
signal = EXIT if current_spread > exit_threshold else HOLD
```

### Position P&L Calculation
```python
# Entry: Buy MEXC spot, Sell Gate.io futures
# Exit: Sell Gate.io spot, Buy Gate.io futures

spot_pnl = (exit_spot_price - entry_mexc_price) / entry_mexc_price
futures_pnl = (entry_futures_price - exit_futures_price) / entry_futures_price
gross_pnl_pct = (spot_pnl + futures_pnl) * 100
net_pnl_pct = gross_pnl_pct - fees_bps/100
pnl_usd = (net_pnl_pct / 100) * position_size_usd
```
