Test Script V2 - Correct Understanding of Arbitrage P&L
=======================================================

The issue is that I was misunderstanding the arbitrage mechanics. Let me clarify:

The profit should simply be the spread convergence applied to the position size.
We don't actually "lose" the $1000 - that's just the position size being traded.
