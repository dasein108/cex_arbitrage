# CEX Arbitrage Engine - Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive refactoring plan for improving the CEX Arbitrage Engine's maintainability, understandability, and long-term sustainability. The plan is based on the detailed code analysis performed by the code-maintainer agent.

## Plan Structure

- **[01_critical_issues.md](01_critical_issues.md)** - Immediate high-priority fixes required
- **[02_structural_improvements.md](02_structural_improvements.md)** - Medium-term architectural enhancements  
- **[03_implementation_timeline.md](03_implementation_timeline.md)** - Phased implementation schedule
- **[04_specific_actions.md](04_specific_actions.md)** - Detailed action items with examples
- **[05_validation_criteria.md](05_validation_criteria.md)** - Success metrics and validation tests

## Quick Start

1. **Start Here**: Read [01_critical_issues.md](01_critical_issues.md) for immediate fixes
2. **Plan Phase**: Review [03_implementation_timeline.md](03_implementation_timeline.md) for scheduling
3. **Execute**: Follow [04_specific_actions.md](04_specific_actions.md) for step-by-step implementation
4. **Validate**: Use [05_validation_criteria.md](05_validation_criteria.md) to confirm success

## Implementation Priority

**Week 1 (Critical)**: Wildcard imports, hardcoded paths
**Week 2-3 (High)**: Configuration management refactoring
**Week 4 (Medium)**: Import patterns standardization
**Ongoing (Low)**: Factory improvements, documentation

## Goals

- **Maintainability**: Reduce coupling, improve cohesion
- **Understandability**: Clear module boundaries, consistent patterns
- **Performance**: Maintain HFT compliance throughout refactoring
- **Safety**: Preserve trading system reliability during changes
