# Hedged Cross-Arbitrage Strategy Diagnosis & Fix

## üö® Root Cause Identified: P&L Calculation Logic Error

### Problem Summary

The hedged cross-arbitrage backtest shows **-6.66% ROI with 0% win rate** due to a **fundamental misunderstanding of the arbitrage strategy mechanics**. While the signal generation logic is working correctly (identifying negative entry spreads and positive exit spreads), the P&L calculation does not properly capture the arbitrage profit.

### Key Findings

1. **Signals Are Working Correctly**:
   - Entry signals trigger on negative MEXC vs Gate.io futures spreads (average -0.76%)
   - Exit signals trigger on positive Gate.io spot vs futures spreads (average +0.48%)
   - All 14 trades show positive spread improvement (average +1.23%)

2. **P&L Calculation Is Flawed**:
   - Theoretical profit from spread convergence: +0.83% average
   - Actual calculated profit: -0.48% average  
   - **Difference: -1.31% per trade** - this is the systematic error

3. **The Core Issue**: The current P&L calculation treats this as two separate directional bets rather than a true arbitrage position that profits from spread convergence.

## üîç Detailed Problem Analysis

### Current (Incorrect) P&L Logic:
```python
# Entry: Buy MEXC spot at ask, Sell Gate.io futures at bid
# Exit: Sell Gate.io spot at bid, Buy Gate.io futures at ask

spot_pnl = (exit_gateio_spot_bid - entry_mexc_ask) / entry_mexc_ask
futures_pnl = (entry_gateio_futures_bid - exit_gateio_futures_ask) / entry_gateio_futures_bid
total_pnl = spot_pnl + futures_pnl
```

**Problem**: This calculation assumes you can buy MEXC spot and then later sell Gate.io spot, which is impossible without transferring assets between exchanges.

### Example Trade Analysis (Trade 1):
- **Entry spread**: MEXC spot cheaper than Gate.io futures by -0.46%
- **Exit spread**: Gate.io spot more expensive than Gate.io futures by +0.37%  
- **Total spread improvement**: +0.83%
- **Theoretical arbitrage profit**: Should capture most of this 0.83%
- **Actual calculated P&L**: -0.29% (systematic loss)

## üí° Correct Arbitrage Strategy Logic

### True Hedged Cross-Arbitrage Process:

1. **Entry Phase**:
   - Identify: MEXC spot < Gate.io futures (negative spread)
   - Action: Buy MEXC spot, Sell Gate.io futures (hedged position)
   - Transfer: Move spot assets from MEXC to Gate.io

2. **Exit Phase**:  
   - Wait for: Gate.io spot > Gate.io futures (positive spread)
   - Action: Sell Gate.io spot, Buy Gate.io futures (close hedge)
   - Profit: Capture the spread difference between entry and exit

### Corrected P&L Calculation:

The profit should be based on the **spread convergence**, not individual leg performance:

```python
# Method 1: Direct spread capture
entry_spread = mexc_spot_price - gateio_futures_price  # Negative (MEXC cheaper)
exit_spread = gateio_spot_price - gateio_futures_price  # Positive (spot more expensive)
arbitrage_profit = exit_spread - entry_spread  # Total spread captured

# Method 2: Asset tracking approach  
# After transfer completion, all assets are on Gate.io
asset_quantity = position_size_usd / entry_mexc_spot_price
exit_spot_proceeds = asset_quantity * exit_gateio_spot_price
exit_futures_cost = asset_quantity * exit_gateio_futures_price
net_proceeds = exit_spot_proceeds - exit_futures_cost
profit = net_proceeds - position_size_usd
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Fixes

### 1. Fix P&L Calculation Logic

Replace the current calculation in `_close_position()` method:

```python
def _close_position(self, position: Position, current_time: datetime, row: pd.Series, reason: str):
    """Close a specific position and calculate PnL - CORRECTED VERSION."""
    
    # Exit prices
    exit_price_gateio_spot = row['gateio_spot_bid_price']  # Sell Gate.io spot
    exit_price_gateio_futures = row['gateio_futures_ask_price']  # Buy Gate.io futures
    
    # Calculate position size in asset units
    asset_quantity = self.config.position_size_usd / position.entry_price_mexc
    
    # Calculate proceeds from closing the arbitrage
    spot_proceeds = asset_quantity * exit_price_gateio_spot
    futures_cost = asset_quantity * exit_price_gateio_futures
    
    # Net proceeds after closing both legs
    net_proceeds = spot_proceeds - futures_cost
    
    # Subtract original position cost
    gross_profit = net_proceeds - self.config.position_size_usd
    
    # Apply fees (entry + exit fees)
    net_profit = gross_profit - (self.config.fees_bps / 10000) * self.config.position_size_usd
    
    # Update position
    position.exit_time = current_time
    position.exit_price_gateio_spot = exit_price_gateio_spot
    position.exit_price_gateio_futures = exit_price_gateio_futures
    position.exit_spread = row['gateio_spot_vs_futures_arb']
    position.exit_signal_reason = reason
    position.pnl = net_profit
    position.holding_period_minutes = int((current_time - position.entry_time).total_seconds() / 60)
    position.status = PositionStatus.CLOSED
    
    # Remove from open positions
    self.open_positions.remove(position)
```

### 2. Validate Against Expected Results

With the corrected calculation:
- **Trade 1**: Spread improvement of +0.83% should yield ~+$6-8 profit (after fees)
- **Trade 2**: Spread improvement of +0.78% should yield ~+$5-7 profit  
- **Trade 3**: Spread improvement of +0.93% should yield ~+$7-9 profit

Expected total P&L: **+$80-120** instead of **-$66.61**

### 3. Additional Validation Checks

Add validation to ensure the strategy logic is sound:

```python
def _validate_arbitrage_opportunity(self, entry_spread: float, exit_spread: float) -> bool:
    """Validate that arbitrage opportunity is profitable."""
    spread_improvement = exit_spread - entry_spread
    min_profitable_spread = (self.config.fees_bps + self.config.spread_bps) / 100
    
    return spread_improvement > min_profitable_spread
```

## üìä Expected Results After Fix

**Theoretical Performance**:
- **Win Rate**: 85-95% (most trades with proper spread convergence should be profitable)
- **Average P&L per Trade**: +$4-6 (after fees)
- **Total P&L**: +$60-80 on 14 trades
- **ROI**: +6-8% on $1,000 position
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Positive (likely 1.5-3.0 range)

## üéØ Implementation Priority

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix the P&L calculation in `_close_position()` method
2. **HIGH**: Re-run backtest with corrected logic
3. **MEDIUM**: Add validation checks for spread convergence
4. **LOW**: Optimize signal thresholds based on corrected results

## üìã Testing Validation

After implementing the fix, verify:
1. P&L calculation matches theoretical spread capture
2. Win rate increases to reasonable levels (>70%)
3. Average trade profitability exceeds fee costs
4. Total backtest P&L becomes positive

The strategy fundamentals are sound - the issue is purely in the P&L calculation methodology.
