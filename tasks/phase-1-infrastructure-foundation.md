# Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation Tasks

**Phase Duration**: 7-12 hours
**Risk Level**: Low
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)

## Overview

Establish the foundational infrastructure for the new direct message handling architecture. This phase creates the base interfaces, compatibility layer, and updated WebSocket Manager without affecting existing functionality.

## Task Breakdown

### T1.1: Create Base WebSocket Interfaces (3-4 hours)

**Objective**: Design and implement base classes for the new direct message handling pattern.

**Deliverables**:
1. `BaseWebSocketClient` abstract class with `_handle_message()` method
2. `PublicWebSocketHandler` base class for public data streams
3. `PrivateWebSocketHandler` base class for private data streams
4. Message type enums and standard event handlers

**Key Design Requirements**:
- Abstract `_handle_message(raw_message: Any) -> None` method
- Template methods for standard events (`_on_orderbook`, `_on_trade`, `_on_ticker`)
- Performance-optimized interface (minimal virtual method overhead)
- Clear separation between public and private handler capabilities

**Files to Create**:
- `/src/infrastructure/networking/websocket/handlers/base_websocket_client.py`
- `/src/infrastructure/networking/websocket/handlers/public_handler.py`
- `/src/infrastructure/networking/websocket/handlers/private_handler.py`
- `/src/infrastructure/networking/websocket/handlers/__init__.py`

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] All base classes compile without errors
- [ ] Abstract methods properly defined and documented
- [ ] Performance interface design reviewed and approved
- [ ] Type hints and documentation complete

---

### T1.2: Implement Compatibility Layer (2-3 hours)

**Objective**: Create a compatibility layer that allows the WebSocket Manager to operate with both old (strategy pattern) and new (direct handling) architectures simultaneously.

**Deliverables**:
1. `WebSocketHandlerAdapter` class to wrap new handlers in old interface
2. `StrategyPatternAdapter` class to wrap old strategies in new interface
3. Configuration flags to switch between architectures per exchange
4. Seamless fallback mechanism for rollback scenarios

**Key Features**:
- **Dual-Path Support**: Route messages through old or new architecture based on configuration
- **Zero-Performance Impact**: Adapter overhead must be negligible (<5ns)
- **Feature Parity**: All existing functionality available through both paths
- **Hot-Swapping**: Ability to switch architectures without restart

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `/src/infrastructure/networking/websocket/adapters/handler_adapter.py`
- `/src/infrastructure/networking/websocket/adapters/strategy_adapter.py`
- `/src/infrastructure/networking/websocket/adapters/__init__.py`

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Both architectures function identically through adapters
- [ ] Performance overhead measured and documented (<5ns)
- [ ] Configuration switching works without connection interruption
- [ ] All existing tests pass with both architectures

---

### T1.3: Update WebSocket Manager for Dual-Path Operation (2-3 hours)

**Objective**: Modify the WebSocket Manager to support both old and new message handling architectures with seamless switching.

**Deliverables**:
1. Updated `WebSocketManager` class with dual-path message routing
2. Configuration system for architecture selection per exchange
3. Performance metrics collection for both paths
4. Graceful degradation and error handling

**Key Changes**:
- **Message Routing Logic**: Detect which architecture to use and route accordingly
- **Configuration Integration**: Read architecture preference from exchange config
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track latency and throughput for both paths
- **Error Isolation**: Prevent failures in one path from affecting the other

**Files to Modify**:
- `/src/infrastructure/networking/websocket/ws_manager.py`
- Add configuration options to exchange configs
- Update performance metrics collection

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
# Pseudo-code for dual-path routing
async def _process_messages(self):
    while True:
        raw_message, queue_time = await self._message_queue.get()
        
        if self.config.use_direct_handling:
            # New architecture: direct _handle_message()
            await self.websocket_handler._handle_message(raw_message)
        else:
            # Legacy architecture: strategy pattern
            parsed = await self.strategies.message_parser.parse_message(raw_message)
            await self.message_handler(parsed)
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] WebSocket Manager operates correctly with both architectures
- [ ] Configuration switching works for individual exchanges
- [ ] Performance metrics accurately capture both paths
- [ ] Error handling maintains system stability
- [ ] All existing integration tests pass

---

### T1.4: Performance Baseline Establishment (1-2 hours)

**Objective**: Establish comprehensive performance baselines for the current architecture to measure improvement after migration.

**Deliverables**:
1. Performance testing framework for WebSocket message processing
2. Baseline metrics for current strategy pattern architecture
3. Automated performance regression detection
4. Benchmark suite for validating new architecture

**Key Metrics to Measure**:
- **Message Processing Latency**: End-to-end time from WebSocket receive to handler completion
- **Function Call Overhead**: Time spent in strategy pattern indirection
- **Memory Allocation**: Objects created during message processing
- **CPU Cache Efficiency**: Cache hit/miss ratios during processing
- **Throughput**: Messages processed per second under load

**Files to Create**:
- `/src/tests/performance/websocket_performance_test.py`
- `/src/tests/performance/baseline_metrics.py`
- `/src/tests/performance/regression_detection.py`

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Baseline metrics collected for all exchange types
- [ ] Performance test suite runs automatically
- [ ] Regression detection system operational
- [ ] Metrics collection has minimal performance impact (<1Î¼s)
