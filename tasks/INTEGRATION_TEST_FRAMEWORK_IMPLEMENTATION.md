## Technical Implementation

### Core Framework Architecture

**Test Execution Pipeline:**
```
Test Definition → Test Runner → Performance Validation → Compliance Checking → Report Generation
```

**Key Classes:**
- `IntegrationTestRunner`: Orchestrates test execution with timeout handling and structured reporting
- `HFTComplianceValidator`: Validates performance against HFT requirements  
- `TestResult`: Structured test result with metrics, compliance status, and error details
- `IntegrationTestReport`: Comprehensive test report with JSON export capability

### Performance Validation System

**HFT Compliance Thresholds:**
```python
HFT_THRESHOLDS = {
    "rest_request_max_ms": 5000,         # 5 seconds for REST requests
    "websocket_message_max_ms": 100,     # 100ms for WebSocket messages
    "json_parsing_max_ms": 50,           # 50ms for JSON parsing
    "orderbook_processing_max_ms": 10,   # 10ms for orderbook processing
    "connection_setup_max_ms": 10000,    # 10 seconds for connection setup
    "memory_usage_max_mb": 100,          # 100MB memory limit
    "success_rate_min": 0.95,            # 95% minimum success rate
}
```

**Automatic Performance Measurement:**
- Execution time tracking for all test operations
- Memory usage monitoring during test execution  
- Network request counting and latency measurement
- Data throughput calculation for high-volume operations

### Exchange Integration Pattern

**Adding New Exchange (e.g., Binance):**

1. **Factory Registration** (`src/exchanges/integrations/binance/__init__.py`):
```python
EXCHANGE_NAME = ExchangeName.BINANCE

def create_binance_public_exchange(config, symbols=None, logger=None):
    from .public_exchange import BinancePublicExchange
    return BinancePublicExchange(config=config, symbols=symbols, logger=logger)
```

2. **Parameterized Test Addition** (`tests/integration/rest/test_public_api.py`):
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("exchange", ["mexc_spot", "gateio_spot", "binance_spot"])
async def test_exchange_public_api_compliance(exchange):
    """Automatically tests all supported exchanges."""
    # Test execution is automatic for all listed exchanges
```

3. **Exchange-Specific Configuration** (`tests/integration/exchanges/binance/conftest.py`):
```python
@pytest.fixture
def binance_public_exchange():
    config = HftConfig().get_exchange_config('binance')
    return BinancePublicExchange(config=config)
```

## Usage Examples

### Running Integration Tests

**Basic Test Execution:**
```bash
# Run all integration tests with performance validation
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 RUN_PERFORMANCE_TESTS=1 pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Test specific exchange
pytest tests/integration/rest/test_public_api.py::test_mexc_public_api_integration -v

# Generate detailed reports
pytest tests/integration/ --html=reports/integration_report.html
```

**Environment Configuration:**
```bash
export RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1      # Enable integration test execution
export RUN_PERFORMANCE_TESTS=1      # Enable HFT compliance validation  
export TEST_TIMEOUT=60              # Set test timeout (seconds)
export MEXC_API_KEY="your_key"      # Exchange credentials for private tests
export MEXC_SECRET_KEY="your_secret"
```

### Test Report Analysis

**AI-Agent Compatible Output:**
```json
{
  "exchange": "MEXC",
  "test_suite": "REST_PUBLIC_API_V2",
  "status": "PASSED",
  "total_tests": 5,
  "passed": 5,
