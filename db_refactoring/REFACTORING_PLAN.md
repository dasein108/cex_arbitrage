# Database Layer Refactoring Plan

**Comprehensive plan to simplify the /src/db/ directory into a single DatabaseManager class**

## Executive Summary

The current database layer consists of **12 complex files (~7,600 lines of code)** with distributed functionality, multiple caching layers, and complex interdependencies. This refactoring will consolidate everything into a **simple, unified DatabaseManager class** with approximately **800-1200 lines of code** - a **80-85% reduction in complexity**.

## Current State Analysis

### Current Structure (12 Files, ~7,600 LOC)

1. **models.py** (861 lines) - Complex msgspec models with extensive methods
2. **operations.py** (2,281 lines) - Massive file with all database operations
3. **cache.py** (479 lines) - Complex caching infrastructure
4. **cache_operations.py** (338 lines) - Cache convenience functions
5. **connection.py** (280 lines) - Database connection management
6. **cache_monitor.py** (~200 lines) - Cache performance monitoring
7. **cache_validation.py** (~150 lines) - Cache validation logic
8. **cache_warming.py** (~100 lines) - Cache warming strategies
9. **symbol_sync.py** (~300 lines) - Symbol synchronization
10. **exchange_sync.py** (~200 lines) - Exchange synchronization
11. **symbol_manager.py** (~150 lines) - Symbol management
12. **migrations.py** (~200 lines) - Database migrations

### Key Complexity Issues

**Over-Engineering:**
- 4 separate cache-related files for simple lookup functionality
- Complex msgspec models with 15+ methods each
- Separate sync services for simple data population
- Distributed operations across multiple managers

**Performance Bottlenecks:**
- Multiple cache layers with complex invalidation
- Extensive deduplication logic in operations
- Complex normalized schema joins
- Over-optimized for theoretical HFT requirements

**Maintenance Burden:**
- 16 integration points across the codebase
- Complex interdependencies between cache layers
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Mixed synchronous/asynchronous patterns

## Refactored Solution: Single DatabaseManager Class

### Core Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: One class handles all database operations
2. **Simple Caching**: Built-in dictionary-based caching with TTL
3. **Unified API**: All operations through one consistent interface
4. **Configuration-Driven**: Uses existing HftConfig for database settings
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only asyncpg and standard library

### DatabaseManager Class Structure (~800-1200 LOC)

```python
class DatabaseManager:
    """
    Unified database manager handling all operations with built-in caching.
    Replaces the entire /src/db/ directory with simplified functionality.
    """
    
    # Core Infrastructure (150-200 LOC)
    def __init__(self)
    async def initialize()
    async def close()
    
    # Exchange Operations (100-150 LOC)
    async def get_exchange_by_enum(exchange_enum)
    async def get_all_exchanges()
    async def insert_exchange(exchange_data)
    
    # Symbol Operations (150-200 LOC)
    async def get_symbol_by_id(symbol_id)
    async def get_symbols_by_exchange(exchange_id)
    async def insert_symbol(symbol_data)
    
    # BookTicker Operations (200-250 LOC)
    async def insert_book_ticker_snapshots(snapshots)
    async def get_latest_book_tickers(filters)
    async def get_book_ticker_history(exchange, symbol, hours)
    
    # Balance Operations (150-200 LOC)
    async def insert_balance_snapshots(snapshots)
    async def get_latest_balances(exchange)
    async def get_balance_history(exchange, asset, hours)
    
    # Funding Rate Operations (100-150 LOC)
    async def insert_funding_rates(snapshots)
    async def get_latest_funding_rates(exchange)
    
    # Caching Infrastructure (100-150 LOC)
    def _cache_get(key, cache_type)
    def _cache_set(key, value, cache_type, ttl)
    def _cache_invalidate(pattern)
    
    # Utility Methods (50-100 LOC)
    async def get_database_stats()
    async def cleanup_old_data(retention_policy)
```

### Built-in Simple Caching Strategy

**Single Cache Dictionary with TTL:**
```python
self._cache = {
    'exchanges': {},      # TTL: 300 seconds
    'symbols': {},        # TTL: 300 seconds  
    'latest_data': {}     # TTL: 30 seconds
}
```

**Benefits over Current Complex System:**
- No cache warming or monitoring overhead
- Simple TTL-based invalidation
- Direct dictionary lookups (sub-microsecond)
- Automatic cleanup on expiration
- No complex multi-index strategies
