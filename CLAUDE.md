# CEX Arbitrage Engine - Architecture Overview

High-level architectural overview for the ultra-high-performance CEX arbitrage engine designed for sub-millisecond cryptocurrency trading.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Development Guidelines

**MANDATORY READING**: **[PROJECT_GUIDES.md](PROJECT_GUIDES.md)** contains critical development rules, patterns, and implementation requirements that must be followed to maintain system integrity.

## System Overview

This is a **high-frequency trading (HFT) arbitrage engine** built for professional cryptocurrency trading across multiple exchanges, featuring a **separated domain architecture** where public and private interfaces are completely isolated with no overlap.

### **Separated Domain Architecture (Current)**

**Complete Domain Separation Achieved**:
- **CompositePublicExchange** - ONLY market data operations (orderbooks, trades, tickers, symbols)
- **CompositePrivateExchange** - ONLY trading operations (orders, balances, positions, leverage)
- **FullExchangeFactory** - Factory for creating separate public and private exchange instances
- **No Inheritance** - Private exchanges do NOT inherit from public exchanges
- **Minimal Shared Configuration** - Only static config like symbol_info, never real-time data
- **HFT Safety Compliance** - No caching of real-time trading data across all interfaces

### **Key Performance Achievements**

- **Sub-millisecond logging**: 1.16Î¼s average latency, 859K+ messages/second
- **Symbol resolution**: 0.947Î¼s per lookup with 1M+ ops/second throughput
- **Exchange formatting**: 0.306Î¼s per conversion with 3.2M+ ops/second
- **Complete arbitrage cycle**: <50ms end-to-end execution
- **Memory efficiency**: >95% connection reuse, zero-copy message processing
- **Production reliability**: >99.9% uptime with automatic recovery

## Core Architectural Principles

### **Pragmatic Architecture Guidelines**

The system follows **balanced architectural principles** detailed in specialized documentation:

1. **[Pragmatic SOLID Principles](docs/patterns/pragmatic-solid-principles.md)** - Balanced application prioritizing value over dogma
2. **[LEAN Development Methodology](docs/development/lean-development-methodology.md)** - Implement necessity, avoid speculation
3. **[Exception Handling Patterns](docs/patterns/exception-handling-patterns.md)** - Simplified, composed error handling
4. **[Struct-First Data Policy](docs/data/struct-first-policy.md)** - msgspec.Struct over dict for all modeling
5. **[HFT Performance Requirements](docs/performance/hft-requirements-compliance.md)** - Sub-millisecond targets throughout

### **Separated Domain Architecture**

The system uses **complete domain separation** between public and private exchange operations:

**FullExchangeFactory** â†’ **CompositePublicExchange** (parallel to) **CompositePrivateExchange** â†’ **Exchange Implementations** â†’ **Domain-Specific Data Structures**

**Core Components:**
- **[CompositePublicExchange](docs/architecture/composite-exchange-architecture.md)** - Pure market data interface
- **[CompositePrivateExchange](docs/architecture/composite-exchange-architecture.md)** - Pure trading operations interface
- **[FullExchangeFactory](docs/architecture/composite-exchange-architecture.md)** - Factory for creating separate domain instances
- **[Infrastructure Foundation](docs/infrastructure/)** - Shared networking, logging, and configuration systems
- **[Domain Data Structures](docs/data/struct-first-policy.md)** - msgspec.Struct types specific to each domain

### **Separated Domain Interface Hierarchy**

```
CompositePublicExchange (market data domain - NO authentication)
â”œâ”€â”€ Orderbook Operations (real-time orderbook streaming)
â”œâ”€â”€ Market Data (tickers, trades, klines)
â”œâ”€â”€ Symbol Information (trading rules, precision)
â””â”€â”€ Connection Management (public WebSocket lifecycle)

CompositePrivateExchange (trading domain - requires authentication)
â”œâ”€â”€ Trading Operations (orders, positions, balances)
â”œâ”€â”€ Account Management (portfolio tracking)
â”œâ”€â”€ Trade Execution (spot and futures support)
â””â”€â”€ Connection Management (private WebSocket lifecycle)
```

**Separated Domain Benefits**:
- **Complete Isolation**: Public and private domains have no overlap
- **No Inheritance**: Private exchanges are independent of public exchanges
- **Authentication Boundary**: Clear separation of authenticated vs non-authenticated operations
- **Independent Scaling**: Each domain can scale and optimize independently
- **Security**: Trading operations completely isolated from market data
- **HFT Optimized**: Sub-50ms execution targets in both domains

### **Separated Domain Factory Pattern**

**Independent Exchange Creation with Domain Separation**:

```python
from exchanges.full_exchange_factory import FullExchangeFactory
from exchanges.structs.common import Symbol

# Create factory
factory = FullExchangeFactory()

# Create public exchange (market data domain only)
public_exchange = await factory.create_public_exchange(
    exchange_name='mexc_spot',
    symbols=[Symbol('BTC', 'USDT')]
)
# public_exchange provides: orderbooks, trades, tickers, symbol_info
# public_exchange does NOT provide: balances, orders, positions

# Create private exchange (trading domain only)  
private_exchange = await factory.create_private_exchange(
    exchange_name='mexc_spot'
)
# private_exchange provides: orders, balances, positions, leverage
# private_exchange does NOT provide: orderbooks, trades, market data

# Create both domains separately (NO inheritance relationship)
public, private = await factory.create_exchange_pair(
    exchange_name='mexc_spot',
    symbols=[Symbol('BTC', 'USDT')]
)
# public and private are completely independent instances
# Only symbol_info configuration is shared, never real-time data

# Create multiple separated domain pairs
exchanges = await factory.create_multiple_exchange_pairs(
    exchange_names=['mexc_spot', 'gateio_spot'],
    symbols=[Symbol('BTC', 'USDT'), Symbol('ETH', 'USDT')]
)
```

**Separated Domain Factory Benefits**:
- **Pure Domain Creation**: Each interface handles only its domain
- **No Cross-Domain Dependencies**: Public and private are completely independent
- **Configuration Isolation**: Only static config (symbol_info) shared
- **Authentication Boundary**: Credentials only needed for private domain
- **Independent Optimization**: Each domain optimized for its specific operations

- **Configuration Changes**: [Configuration System](docs/configuration/configuration-system.md)
- **Debugging Issues**: [Exception Handling Patterns](docs/patterns/exception-handling-patterns.md)

### **Key Implementation Rules**
- **Separated Domain Architecture**: Public (market data) and private (trading) are completely isolated
- **No Inheritance**: Private exchanges do NOT inherit from public exchanges
- **Authentication Boundary**: Public operations require no auth, private operations require credentials
- **Minimal Configuration Sharing**: Only static config like symbol_info, never real-time data
- **HFT Caching Policy**: NEVER cache real-time trading data (balances, orders, positions, orderbooks)
- **Struct-First Policy**: msgspec.Struct over dict for all data modeling
- **LEAN Development**: Implement necessity, avoid speculation
- **Pragmatic SOLID**: Apply principles where they add value

## ðŸš¨ Critical Trading Safety Rules

### **HFT Caching Policy**

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never cache real-time trading data in HFT systems.

**PROHIBITED (Real-time Data)**:
- Account balances, order status, position data
- Orderbook snapshots, recent trades, market data

**PERMITTED (Static Configuration)**:
- Symbol mappings, exchange configuration, trading rules

**RATIONALE**: Caching real-time data causes stale price execution, failed arbitrage, phantom liquidity, and compliance violations. This rule supersedes ALL performance considerations.

See **[Caching Policy](docs/performance/caching-policy.md)** for complete safety guidelines.
