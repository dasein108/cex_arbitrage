# CEX Arbitrage Engine - Architecture Overview

High-level architectural overview for the ultra-high-performance CEX arbitrage engine designed for sub-millisecond cryptocurrency trading.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Development Guidelines

**MANDATORY READING**: **[PROJECT_GUIDES.md](PROJECT_GUIDES.md)** contains critical development rules, patterns, and implementation requirements that must be followed to maintain system integrity.

## System Overview

This is a **high-frequency trading (HFT) arbitrage engine** built for professional cryptocurrency trading across multiple exchanges, featuring a **unified architecture** that consolidates exchange functionality into single, coherent interfaces.

### **Unified Exchange Architecture (Current)**

**Major Consolidation Completed**:
- **UnifiedCompositeExchange** - Single interface combining public + private exchange functionality  
- **UnifiedExchangeFactory** - Simplified factory using config_manager pattern
- **Two Complete Implementations** - MexcUnifiedExchange and GateioUnifiedExchange
- **Legacy Interface Removal** - Eliminated AbstractPrivateExchange vs CompositePrivateExchange redundancy
- **HFT Safety Compliance** - Removed all dangerous caching of real-time trading data

### **Key Performance Achievements**

- **Sub-millisecond logging**: 1.16Î¼s average latency, 859K+ messages/second
- **Symbol resolution**: 0.947Î¼s per lookup with 1M+ ops/second throughput
- **Exchange formatting**: 0.306Î¼s per conversion with 3.2M+ ops/second
- **Complete arbitrage cycle**: <50ms end-to-end execution
- **Memory efficiency**: >95% connection reuse, zero-copy message processing
- **Production reliability**: >99.9% uptime with automatic recovery

## Core Architectural Principles

### **Pragmatic Architecture Guidelines**

The system follows **balanced architectural principles** detailed in specialized documentation:

1. **[Pragmatic SOLID Principles](docs/patterns/pragmatic-solid-principles.md)** - Balanced application prioritizing value over dogma
2. **[LEAN Development Methodology](docs/development/lean-development-methodology.md)** - Implement necessity, avoid speculation
3. **[Exception Handling Patterns](docs/patterns/exception-handling-patterns.md)** - Simplified, composed error handling
4. **[Struct-First Data Policy](docs/data/struct-first-policy.md)** - msgspec.Struct over dict for all modeling
5. **[HFT Performance Requirements](docs/performance/hft-requirements-compliance.md)** - Sub-millisecond targets throughout

### **Unified Exchange Architecture**

The system has evolved from legacy multiple-interface complexity to a **single unified interface** per exchange:

**UnifiedExchangeFactory** â†’ **UnifiedCompositeExchange** â†’ **Exchange Implementations** â†’ **Common Data Structures**

**Core Components:**
- **[UnifiedCompositeExchange](docs/architecture/unified-exchange-architecture.md)** - Single interface combining public + private operations
- **[UnifiedExchangeFactory](docs/architecture/unified-exchange-architecture.md)** - Simplified factory with config_manager pattern
- **[Infrastructure Foundation](docs/infrastructure/)** - Networking, logging, and configuration systems
- **[Common Data Structures](docs/data/struct-first-policy.md)** - Unified msgspec.Struct types across all exchanges

### **Unified Interface Hierarchy**

```
UnifiedCompositeExchange (single interface)
â”œâ”€â”€ Market Data Operations (public - no authentication required)
â”œâ”€â”€ Trading Operations (private - credentials required)
â”œâ”€â”€ Resource Management (lifecycle and connections)
â””â”€â”€ Performance Monitoring (health and metrics)
```

**Unified Design Benefits**:
- **Single Integration Point**: One interface per exchange eliminates complexity
- **Combined Functionality**: Market data + trading operations for arbitrage strategies
- **HFT Optimized**: Sub-50ms execution targets throughout
- **Resource Management**: Proper async context manager support
- **Clear Purpose**: Optimized specifically for arbitrage trading operations

### **Unified Factory Pattern**

**Simplified Exchange Creation with Config Manager**:

```python

from exchanges.full_exchange_factory import FullExchangeFactory
from src.exchanges.structs.common import Symbol

# Create unified factory
factory = FullExchangeFactory()

# Create single exchange (config loaded automatically)
exchange = await factory.create_exchange(
  exchange_name='mexc_spot',
  symbols=[Symbol('BTC', 'USDT')]
)

# Create multiple exchanges concurrently
exchanges = await factory.create_multiple_exchanges(
  exchange_names=['mexc_spot', 'gateio_spot', 'gateio_futures'],
  symbols=[Symbol('BTC', 'USDT'), Symbol('ETH', 'USDT')]
)
```

**Unified Factory Benefits**:
- **Simplified API**: Single method for exchange creation
- **Config Manager Integration**: Automatic configuration loading
- **Concurrent Creation**: Multiple exchanges created in parallel
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of individual exchange failures

### **HFT Logging System**

Comprehensive high-performance logging architecture designed for sub-millisecond trading operations. Full details in **[HFT Logging System](docs/infrastructure/hft-logging-system.md)**.

**Performance Specifications Achieved**:
- **Latency**: 1.16Î¼s average (target: <1ms) âœ…
- **Throughput**: 859,598+ messages/second sustained âœ…
- **Memory**: Ring buffer with configurable size

### **Key Implementation Rules**
- **UnifiedCompositeExchange**: Single interface per exchange (no separate public/private)
- **HFT Caching Policy**: NEVER cache real-time trading data (balances, orders, positions)
- **Struct-First Policy**: msgspec.Struct over dict for all data modeling  
- **LEAN Development**: Implement necessity, avoid speculation
- **Pragmatic SOLID**: Apply principles where they add value

## ðŸš¨ Critical Trading Safety Rules

### **HFT Caching Policy**

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never cache real-time trading data in HFT systems.

**PROHIBITED (Real-time Data)**:
- Account balances, order status, position data
- Orderbook snapshots, recent trades, market data

**PERMITTED (Static Configuration)**:
- Symbol mappings, exchange configuration, trading rules

**RATIONALE**: Caching real-time data causes stale price execution, failed arbitrage, phantom liquidity, and compliance violations. This rule supersedes ALL performance considerations.

See **[Caching Policy](docs/performance/caching-policy.md)** for complete safety guidelines.
