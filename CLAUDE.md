# CEX Arbitrage Engine - Architecture Overview

High-level architectural overview for the ultra-high-performance CEX arbitrage engine designed for sub-millisecond cryptocurrency trading.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Development Guidelines

**MANDATORY READING**: **[PROJECT_GUIDES.md](PROJECT_GUIDES.md)** contains critical development rules, patterns, and implementation requirements that must be followed to maintain system integrity.

## System Overview

This is a **high-frequency trading (HFT) arbitrage engine** built for professional cryptocurrency trading across multiple exchanges, featuring a **separated domain architecture** where public and private interfaces are completely isolated with no overlap.

### **Separated Domain Architecture with Constructor Injection (Current)**

**Complete Domain Separation with Modern Patterns**:
- **CompositePublicExchange** - ONLY market data operations (orderbooks, trades, tickers, symbols)
- **CompositePrivateExchange** - ONLY trading operations (orders, balances, positions, leverage)
- **Simplified Exchange Factory** - Direct mapping-based factory with constructor injection
- **Constructor Injection Pattern** - REST/WebSocket clients injected via constructors
- **Explicit Cooperative Inheritance** - WebsocketBindHandlerInterface explicitly initialized
- **Handler Binding Pattern** - WebSocket channels bound to handler methods using `.bind()`
- **No Complex Inheritance** - Private exchanges do NOT inherit from public exchanges
- **Minimal Shared Configuration** - Only static config like symbol_info, never real-time data
- **HFT Safety Compliance** - No caching of real-time trading data across all interfaces

### **Key Performance Achievements**

- **Sub-millisecond logging**: 1.16Î¼s average latency, 859K+ messages/second
- **Symbol resolution**: 0.947Î¼s per lookup with 1M+ ops/second throughput
- **Exchange formatting**: 0.306Î¼s per conversion with 3.2M+ ops/second
- **Complete arbitrage cycle**: <50ms end-to-end execution
- **Memory efficiency**: >95% connection reuse, zero-copy message processing
- **Production reliability**: >99.9% uptime with automatic recovery

## Core Architectural Principles

### **Pragmatic Architecture Guidelines**

The system follows **balanced architectural principles** detailed in specialized documentation:

1. **[Pragmatic SOLID Principles](specs/patterns/pragmatic-solid-principles.md)** - Balanced application prioritizing value over dogma
2. **[LEAN Development Methodology](specs/patterns/lean-development-methodology.md)** - Implement necessity, avoid speculation
3. **[Exception Handling Patterns](specs/patterns/exception-handling-patterns.md)** - Simplified, composed error handling
4. **[Struct-First Data Policy](specs/data/struct-first-policy.md)** - msgspec.Struct over dict for all modeling
5. **[HFT Performance Requirements](specs/performance/hft-requirements-compliance.md)** - Sub-millisecond targets throughout

### **Separated Domain Architecture**

The system uses **complete domain separation** between public and private exchange operations:

**FullExchangeFactory** â†’ **CompositePublicExchange** (parallel to) **CompositePrivateExchange** â†’ **Exchange Implementations** â†’ **Domain-Specific Data Structures**

**Core Components:**
- **[CompositePublicExchange](specs/architecture/unified-exchange-architecture.md)** - Pure market data interface
- **[CompositePrivateExchange](specs/architecture/unified-exchange-architecture.md)** - Pure trading operations interface
- **[Unified Exchange Factory](docs/factory/unified-exchange-factory.md)** - Single entry point for all exchange components
- **[Networking Infrastructure](specs/networking/)** - High-performance REST and WebSocket systems
- **[Domain Data Structures](specs/data/struct-first-policy.md)** - msgspec.Struct types specific to each domain

### **Separated Domain Interface Hierarchy**

```
CompositePublicExchange (market data domain - NO authentication)
â”œâ”€â”€ Orderbook Operations (real-time orderbook streaming)
â”œâ”€â”€ Market Data (tickers, trades, klines)
â”œâ”€â”€ Symbol Information (trading rules, precision)
â””â”€â”€ Connection Management (public WebSocket lifecycle)

CompositePrivateExchange (trading domain - requires authentication)
â”œâ”€â”€ Trading Operations (orders, positions, balances)
â”œâ”€â”€ Account Management (portfolio tracking)
â”œâ”€â”€ Trade Execution (spot and futures support)
â””â”€â”€ Connection Management (private WebSocket lifecycle)
```

**Separated Domain Benefits**:
- **Complete Isolation**: Public and private domains have no overlap
- **No Inheritance**: Private exchanges are independent of public exchanges
- **Authentication Boundary**: Clear separation of authenticated vs non-authenticated operations
- **Independent Scaling**: Each domain can scale and optimize independently
- **Security**: Trading operations completely isolated from market data
- **HFT Optimized**: Sub-50ms execution targets in both domains

### **Simplified Exchange Factory with Constructor Injection**

**Modern Factory Pattern with Direct Mapping**:

```python
from exchanges.exchange_factory import (
    get_rest_implementation, 
    get_ws_implementation, 
    get_composite_implementation
)
from config.structs import ExchangeConfig
from exchanges.structs.enums import ExchangeEnum

# Direct factory functions with constructor injection
# Create REST client
rest_client = get_rest_implementation(mexc_config, is_private=False)

# Create WebSocket client
ws_client = get_ws_implementation(mexc_config, is_private=False)

# Create composite exchange with injected dependencies
trading_exchange = get_composite_implementation(mexc_config, is_private=True)
# Components are automatically created and injected via constructor

# Manual construction for advanced use cases
from exchanges.integrations.mexc.mexc_unified_exchange import MexcPublicExchange
from exchanges.integrations.mexc.rest.mexc_rest_public import MexcPublicSpotRest
from exchanges.integrations.mexc.ws.mexc_public_websocket import MexcPublicSpotWebsocketBaseWebsocket

# Constructor injection pattern
rest = MexcPublicSpotRest(config)
ws = MexcPublicSpotWebsocketBaseWebsocket(config)
public_exchange = MexcPublicExchange(
    config=config,
    rest_client=rest,      # Injected via constructor
    websocket_client=ws    # Injected via constructor
)
```

**Simplified Factory Benefits**:
- **Direct Mapping**: Simple dictionary-based component lookup
- **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies injected at creation time
- **No Complex Caching**: Eliminates validation and decision matrix complexity
- **Performance Optimized**: ~110 lines vs 467 lines (76% reduction)
- **Type Safety**: Clear mapping tables prevent runtime errors
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing code works via compatibility wrappers

### **Key Implementation Rules**
- **Separated Domain Architecture**: Public (market data) and private (trading) are completely isolated
- **Constructor Injection Pattern**: REST/WebSocket clients injected via constructors, not factory methods
- **Explicit Cooperative Inheritance**: `WebsocketBindHandlerInterface.__init__(self)` called explicitly
- **Handler Binding Pattern**: WebSocket channels connected using `.bind()` method in constructors
- **No Complex Inheritance**: Private exchanges do NOT inherit from public exchanges
- **Authentication Boundary**: Public operations require no auth, private operations require credentials
- **Minimal Configuration Sharing**: Only static config like symbol_info, never real-time data
- **HFT Caching Policy**: NEVER cache real-time trading data (balances, orders, positions, orderbooks)
- **Struct-First Policy**: msgspec.Struct over dict for all data modeling
- **LEAN Development**: Implement necessity, avoid speculation
- **Pragmatic SOLID**: Apply principles where they add value

## ðŸš¨ Critical Trading Safety Rules

### **HFT Caching Policy**

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never cache real-time trading data in HFT systems.

**PROHIBITED (Real-time Data)**:
- Account balances, order status, position data
- Orderbook snapshots, recent trades, market data

**PERMITTED (Static Configuration)**:
- Symbol mappings, exchange configuration, trading rules

**RATIONALE**: Caching real-time data causes stale price execution, failed arbitrage, phantom liquidity, and compliance violations. This rule supersedes ALL performance considerations.

See **[Caching Policy](specs/performance/caching-policy.md)** for complete safety guidelines.
