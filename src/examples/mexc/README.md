## Architecture Overview

### Hybrid Architecture Benefits

The MEXC exchange implementation uses the hybrid architecture pattern where:

- **BaseExchangeInterface** handles common functionality:
  - Orderbook management and storage
  - REST API initialization sequence  
  - Reconnection handling with exponential backoff
  - Update notification system for arbitrage layer
  - Statistics and monitoring
  - Graceful shutdown coordination

- **MexcPublicExchange** implements exchange-specific details:
  - MEXC REST API integration
  - MEXC WebSocket message handling
  - Exchange-specific data parsing
  - Symbol mapping and configuration

### Key Features

1. **Update Handler System**
   - Arbitrage engines register handlers with exchanges
   - Base class coordinates notifications to all handlers
   - Consistent OrderBook and Symbol formats across exchanges

2. **Connection Management**
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - REST snapshot reload on reconnection
   - Connection health monitoring

3. **Statistics and Monitoring**
   - Real-time performance metrics
   - Connection status tracking
   - Update processing statistics

4. **Thread-Safe Operations**
   - Copy-on-read orderbook access
   - Safe concurrent access to exchange data
   - Proper resource cleanup

## Integration Patterns

### Arbitrage Layer Integration

```python
# Register update handler
async def arbitrage_handler(symbol, orderbook, update_type):
    if update_type == OrderbookUpdateType.DIFF:
        process_arbitrage_opportunity(symbol, orderbook)
    elif update_type == OrderbookUpdateType.SNAPSHOT:
        initialize_symbol_state(symbol, orderbook)

exchange.add_orderbook_update_handler(arbitrage_handler)
await exchange.initialize(symbols)
```

### Multi-Exchange Coordination

```python
# Unified handler for multiple exchanges
exchanges = [mexc_exchange, gateio_exchange]
for exchange in exchanges:
    exchange.add_orderbook_update_handler(unified_handler)
    await exchange.initialize(common_symbols)
```

## Running the Demos

All demos are designed to be safe to run without:
- Real API credentials
- Network connectivity  
- Complex configuration setup

Simply run any demo with:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python src/examples/mexc/<demo_name>.py
```

## Next Steps

After exploring the demos:

1. **Set up real configuration** for live testing
2. **Integrate with arbitrage components** using the handler patterns
3. **Extend to additional exchanges** using the same hybrid architecture
4. **Implement custom monitoring** using the statistics API
