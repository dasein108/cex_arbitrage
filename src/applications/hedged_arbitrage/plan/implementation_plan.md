# Hedged Arbitrage Implementation Plan

## Strategy Overview

**3-Exchange Delta Neutral Arbitrage for NEIROETH**
- **Phase 1**: Establish delta neutral position (Gate.io Spot vs Gate.io Futures)
- **Phase 2**: Execute arbitrage between spot exchanges based on spread analysis
- **Target Asset**: NEIROETH/USDT across Gate.io Spot, Gate.io Futures, MEXC Spot

## Current Todo List Status

### Completed Tasks ✅
1. **Analyze current delta neutral task implementation and codebase**
2. **Design 3-exchange delta neutral arbitrage architecture**

### In Progress Tasks 🔄
3. **Create NEIROETH symbol configurations for all 3 exchanges**

### Pending Tasks 📋
4. **Implement analytics data fetcher for book_ticker data**
5. **Build spread calculation and analysis engine**
6. **Create PnL estimation tools with fee calculations**
7. **Design state machine for arbitrage strategy**
8. **Implement historical spread analytics and indicators**
9. **Create enhanced delta neutral task with 3-exchange coordination**
10. **Integrate with TaskManager and existing infrastructure**

## State Machine Design

```
INITIALIZING → ESTABLISHING_DN → MONITORING → ARBITRAGING → MONITORING
     ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓           ↓
   ERROR ←── ERROR ←── ERROR ←── ERROR ←── REBALANCING
     ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓           ↓
   CLOSING ←── CLOSING ←── CLOSING ←── CLOSING ←── CLOSING
```

### State Definitions
- **INITIALIZING**: Setup connections, validate balances, prepare exchanges
- **ESTABLISHING_DN**: Create delta neutral position (Gate.io Spot/Futures)
- **MONITORING**: Track spreads between exchanges, wait for opportunities
- **ARBITRAGING**: Execute buy/sell operations when spread > 0.1%
- **REBALANCING**: Adjust positions to maintain delta neutrality
- **CLOSING**: Exit all positions and cleanup
- **ERROR**: Handle exceptions with recovery mechanisms

## Implementation Components

### 1. Database Analytics (`hedged_arbitrage/analytics/`)

#### data_fetcher.py
- Real-time book_ticker queries for NEIROETH
- Historical data retrieval with time-based filtering
- Symbol ID resolution and caching
- **Performance Target**: <10ms query latency

#### spread_analyzer.py
- Cross-exchange spread calculations
- Historical spread pattern analysis
- Statistical metrics (volatility, trends, percentiles)
- Arbitrage opportunity detection
- **Trigger Thresholds**: >0.1% entry, <0.01% exit

#### pnl_calculator.py
- Profit estimation with exchange-specific fees
- Gate.io Spot: 0.2%, Gate.io Futures: 0.075%, MEXC: 0.2%
- Slippage modeling based on order book depth
- Risk-adjusted return calculations
- Funding rate impact analysis

#### performance_tracker.py
- Execution timing analysis
- Success rate and win/loss tracking
- Sharpe ratio and risk metrics calculation
- Drawdown analysis and maximum adverse excursion

### 2. Exchange Configuration

#### NEIROETH Symbol Mappings
- **Gate.io Spot**: NEIROETH_USDT
- **Gate.io Futures**: NEIROETH_USDT (perpetual contract)
- **MEXC Spot**: NEIROETH_USDT

#### Exchange-Specific Settings
- Rate limits and connection management
- Trading precision and lot sizes
- Minimum order quantities
- Fee structures and funding rates

### 3. Strategy Implementation (`hedged_arbitrage/strategy/`)

#### delta_neutral_arbitrage_task.py
- Enhanced version of existing DeltaNeutralTask
- 3-exchange coordination logic
- State machine implementation
- Spread-based decision engine

#### state_machine.py
- State management and transitions
- Error handling and recovery
- Persistence and task recovery
- Integration with TaskManager

## Technical Specifications

### Performance Requirements
- **Execution Latency**: <50ms for complete arbitrage cycle
- **Database Queries**: <10ms for real-time data retrieval
- **State Transitions**: <5ms for decision making
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient msgspec.Struct usage throughout

### Risk Management
- **Position Limits**: Maximum 10% of portfolio per strategy
- **Spread Validation**: Sanity checks on price differences
- **Latency Monitoring**: Ensure sub-50ms execution times
- **Liquidity Checks**: Validate order book depth before execution

### Data Safety Rules
- **NEVER cache real-time trading data** (balances, orders, positions, orderbooks)
- **Cache only static configuration** (symbol IDs, exchange settings, fee schedules)
- **Validate all price data** before calculations
- **Monitor data staleness** and timing
