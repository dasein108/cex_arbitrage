HFT Arbitrage Balance Monitor

Real-time balance tracking and management across multiple exchanges
with HFT-compliant refresh cycles and comprehensive balance validation.

Architecture:
- Real-time balance tracking across all exchanges
- HFT-compliant balance refresh (no caching of real-time data)
- Cross-exchange balance synchronization
- Insufficient balance detection and alerting
- Balance reservation and allocation management
- Automatic balance refresh optimization

Balance Management Features:
- Sub-second balance refresh capabilities
- Cross-exchange balance aggregation
- Reserved balance tracking for pending orders
- Minimum balance threshold monitoring
- Balance discrepancy detection and reconciliation
- Emergency balance validation procedures

Performance Targets:
- <100ms balance refresh per exchange
- <50ms balance validation checks
- <10ms balance reservation operations
- Real-time balance change notifications
- >99.9% balance tracking accuracy
