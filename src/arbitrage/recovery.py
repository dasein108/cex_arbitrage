HFT Arbitrage Recovery Manager

Comprehensive recovery system for handling partial executions, failed operations,
and emergency position management with automated recovery procedures.

Architecture:
- Automated recovery from partial executions
- Intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff
- Emergency position unwinding capabilities
- Manual intervention coordination
- Recovery strategy selection and optimization
- Comprehensive recovery audit trail

Recovery Scenarios:
- Partial execution recovery (spot filled, futures failed)
- Order placement failures with position recovery
- Exchange connectivity issues during execution
- Market condition changes during execution
- Circuit breaker recovery procedures
- Emergency position liquidation

Performance Targets:
- <100ms recovery initiation response
- <30 seconds typical recovery completion
- >95% automated recovery success rate
- <5 minutes maximum recovery time
- Comprehensive recovery logging and audit
